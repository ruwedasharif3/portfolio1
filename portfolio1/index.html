          <h1>Hi I'm Ruweda,</h1>
          <p>I'm an aspiring full-stack developer, currently enrolled in an intensive 12-week software development bootcamp where I'm building a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies. My current focus includes mastering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and React, all essential tools for creating responsive, user-friendly web applications.
            Beyond coding, I’m passionate about continuous learning and enjoy exploring the creative side of problem-solving through design and user experience. When I’m not at my computer, I like to spend my time reading , staying active through fitness, and creating visual art. These interests not only keep me balanced but also fuel my creativity and focus as a developer.</p>

            <p>This is one of my first projects, a calculator website that completes basic arithmetic, allowing users to perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division through a simple and user-friendly interface.</p>

            <h3>Project Two</h3>
            <p>This is another project I worked on, a basic rock-paper-scissors game against the computer, where the user can choose their move and the computer randomly selects one, with the game displaying the winner after each round.</p>

            <p>This project is a useful encoder/decoder that helps turn messages into a secret code and then back again, making it easy to share information safely.</p>

            <p>This is my rendition of a very basic social media app for pets, created with React, where users can share their posts and view their posts on their pin board.</p>
